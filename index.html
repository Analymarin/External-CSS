  <img src="crepes.jpg">
  <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="https://rb.gy/mhdimx">1 cup of All-purpose Flour</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://rb.gy/jo0j5h">2 Large Eggs</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://rb.gy/yy2xkm">1/2 cup of milk</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://rb.gy/b2xbpl">1/2 cup of water</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://rb.gy/v0yn1y">1/4 teaspoon of salt</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://rb.gy/qbrmcj">2 tablespoons of butter, melted</a></li>
     </ul>
  <p><br></p>
     <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water,
          <br>stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
         <br> using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
         <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
